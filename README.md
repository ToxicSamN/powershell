# powershell

This is a random library of various scripts I have written in powershell since I started writing scripts in powershell in 2008. Some are better than others and some probably do not work any longer but may still have relevant bits within. Some are well commented while others are not. Some look like a third grader wrote them while others look well written and commented. Don't judge me! I didn't know what I didn't know.
